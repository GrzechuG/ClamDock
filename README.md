# DockerDefender 🛡️🔍  
**A Host-Based Malware Scanner for Running Docker Containers**  

## 📖 Overview  
DockerDefender is a security tool that runs on the **host system**, scanning actively running Docker containers for malware **from outside the containerized environment**. It integrates with **ClamAV** to detect threats in containers without needing to run inside them. Key features include:  
- **Full container scans** from the host system  
- **Real-time monitoring** of new files inside containers  
- **Automatic removal** of detected malware  
- **Database tracking** of container file changes  
- **Popup alerts** for malware detection  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Scans all running containers for malware **from the host system**  
✅ Runs **outside of containers** for enhanced security  
✅ Supports **ClamAV** (`clamscan` or `clamdscan`) for detection  
✅ Tracks newly created files inside containers  
✅ Periodic monitoring for continuous security  
✅ Optional **automatic deletion** of infected files  
✅ SQLite database for tracking scanned files  
✅ Popup alerts for immediate threat notifications

## 🚀 Installation  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Ensure Docker and ClamAV are installed on your system.  

#### 📌 Install Docker  
[Follow Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  

#### 📌 Install ClamAV  
On **Ubuntu/Debian**:  
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon -y
```
On **CentOS/RHEL**:  
```sh
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install clamav clamav-update -y
```
On **Mac (Homebrew)**:  
```sh
brew install clamav
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/docker-defender.git
cd docker-defender
```

### 3️⃣ Run DockerDefender  
```sh
sudo python3 docker_defender.py scan
```

---

## 🔥 Usage  

DockerDefender provides three main modes:  

### 🔎 **Scan Running Containers**
Scans all actively running containers for malware.  
```sh
sudo python3 docker_defender.py scan
```

### 🔄 **Monitor Containers for New Files**
Continuously monitors running containers for new files and scans them at a set interval.  
```sh
sudo python3 docker_defender.py monitor --interval 30
```
- `--interval <seconds>`: Time between scans (default: 60s)  
- `--popup`: Show a popup alert if malware is found  

### 🛡️ **Defend Containers (Auto-Delete Malware)**
Automatically removes detected malware from all running containers.  
```sh
sudo python3 docker_defender.py defend
```

---

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Detects Running Containers**  
   Uses `docker ps` to list all active containers.  

2. **Extracts Container Filesystem Paths**  
   Retrieves `MergedDir` from `docker inspect`, which represents the container's overlay filesystem.  

3. **Scans Files for Malware**  
   Runs **ClamAV** (`clamdscan` or `clamscan`) on container files.  

4. **Tracks File Changes**  
   Uses an **SQLite database** to track existing files and detect newly created ones.  

5. **Alerts on Detection**  
   Shows warnings in the terminal and optionally **triggers a popup alert**.  

6. **Auto-Removes Infected Files** (if enabled)
